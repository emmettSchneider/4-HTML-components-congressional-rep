        <section class=rep_info>
            <p>Congressman Jim Cooper was born and raised in Tennessee. He and Martha, 
                his wife of thirty-three years, live in Nashville and have three children. </p>

            <p>A New York Times columnist called him "the House's conscience, a lonely voice 
                for civility in this ugly era" and a "tart-tongued moderate" who "seeks 
                bipartisanship on fiscal matters and other issues in a polarized political 
                climate." USA Today named him one of the "Brave 38" of a "tiny band of heroes" 
                in Congress for his work on a bipartisan budget plan. </p>
                
            <p>In Congress, he's known for his work on the federal budget, health care and 
                government reform. He's also a businessman, attorney and part-time Vanderbilt 
                professor when Congress is not in session.</p>
